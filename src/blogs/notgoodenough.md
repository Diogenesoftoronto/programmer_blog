Be warned, this article is for those willing to peer into the mind of a person trying to get their life together at 3am. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oabHBtt5ic) for reference.

Just wanted to rant a bit about the fact that I feel inadequate about getting a job in tech until I have a much deeper understanding of computer science. I feel this way even after I have helped design course for students learning the subject and have helped many people understand it. The fact is that I am still pretty terrible at Leetcode easy problems. I want to be able to easily solve medium problems and be able to solve hard problems with a decent amount of time given. This is possible if I really study for about two months. It is getting to the end of the line for me being in my parent's home now. 

I really want to find work more than I want to solve my imposter syndrome (is it really a syndrome if I am an imposter? The imposter Amogus?). The only way for me to cope is to make better projects post those and apply to see what I can get. Today I finally got my linktree finalized for the most part (I am going to copy the damn thing and self host eventually with a heroku app probably ðŸ˜ˆ). 

That leaves me to my next problem. I don't have any super amazing legend defying projects that are complete. I have lots of hamfisted half finished lame-o cablame-o ones. But nothing super impressive. Problem is I have a lot of ideas and not enough motivation to finish everything all the time. So despite me actually now having the confidence of the lionking, I still have a lot of projects to do. It's never enough. It's never enough. It's never enough.

Okay, let's step back and look at what I wrote so far. 


Woah. Okay. That was intense. Nope, not true. Okay is this dialogue now? Is this text speaking to me or the reader? Okay, enough fourth wall breaks. 

Yeah so, So I need a job but I am not actually applying to them because I actually don't have a resume I am confident in and I am not confident in it because it doesn't have as cool projects as I would hope. But I am worried that If it doesn't have any cool projects, I will not get a job. So, I can't finish the resume until I get a really cool project done. Also, I am worried my algorithms aren't good enough to solve the problems in interviews so I won't even be able to pass interviews anyway! Ugh. THIS SUCKS. But its a hell of my own making. I need to do a couple things to improve this. 

1. Reference project that are not complete yet but that I am actively working on. Mention three and only three from the least cool and complete to the most cool and incomplete project.

1. Start talking to recruiters again to get my resume vetted and to get me on their radar again once I really do have that project ready.

1. Consider supplementary course I can do. And actually continue working on my DSA everyday to improve limit yourself to an hour a day no more. And don't watch videos. You know enough to just code the damn thing now.

1. Start working on a project that is not complete but close to it so you can finish it off and say that it is done. Add some cool features but don't go too deep. If it has a front-end focus on that. Smoke and Mirrors.

1. Pump out content working on this stuff as often as possible to get people interested and build your ðŸŒˆ brand-cocoon ðŸŒˆ. 

1. Actually get to streaming your stuff on twitch, and posting the videos you made on youtube. Do the bare minimum video and audio editing stuff. Spend very little time on that just get better at single takes. 

That leaves me with a few extra tips like pacing, breaking up my work environments by going outside, and continue with my reading and writing habits. Possibly some scripting for my podcasts would be nice as well. 

Now that I have written all this its 4am and my brain has partially stopped working. Good luck future me. This is my first blogpost for github ðŸ¥´.
