# Failure and Improvement

Today I am going to be discussing how I started to improve at things that I have left on the burner for a long time. The way I did it was to just start to do the thing that I wanted to get better at. I wanted to learn to cook something I would just cook it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again until I get it right. However, I would never do it at the same time. I would never do the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again one after the other sequentially. Instead, when I got bored or frustrated or tired of doing it I would stop and go onto the next thing. Essentially, I would stop and start things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. This way I would cycle through the different skills I wanted to build and didn't that much time to distract myself with frivilous activities. I think this is the best way to improve. It's okay to quit in short bursts. As soon as you don't enjoy doing the thing try it once more then tell yourself to try a completely different task. 

I call this, productive procrastination. And It gives me the ability to produce a large amount of continent of decent quality. Now, it doesn't start out as decent content and it isn't immediately released but it lets me practice multiple skills in a day. But also helps me practice the ultimate skill: *practicing*. That's right, I practice how to practice, how to plan, how to be comfortable with failure every day as I learn new things, communicate and share that with others to further improve again. It is something I love doing and will continue to do.
