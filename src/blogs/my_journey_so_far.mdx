# The Journey Project
Every day i try to learn about some concept in programming today i spent about an hour learning about uml and pointers in C. It was quite boring and I didn't get to the harder parts of the lessons but I feel like I learned enough to be more porductive with the concepts at hand. I will try to finish a few more lessons on UML and pointers in C tomorrow. What I also have been doing is trying to get started with unity in a serious measure. I want to learn as much as I can about the entire stack of software development so that I can build some confidence in practically any tool and talk to almost any engineer or designer about the subject. Enough to have a conversation about the subject is usually enough to get the ball rolling and get noticed. At the same time I do have to continue actually creating complete projects that are more noticiable. For example, I am going to fork and work on a wikimaps project that another engineer I know has so that I can have something interesting to present to the the Gameloft people.
