# Binary Arrays
I wanted to write an article on binary arrays because I have been having such trouble actually solving one of the leet code questions where you must find the maximum of a binary array. I wanted to solve it through looping through it once but I am not sure it is possible. I think it might be every time I think about it. 

## What is a binary array?
A binary array is an array with only a one or a zero or alternatively any list with two possible values. Some examples of uses fro binary arrays are morse code values, the results of any list of logic or truth tables, and buffers for a stream of data into your files. It could be a list of so many things that have two possible states. Finding the max value is also useful because it can tell us how many times some event was sucessful, for example it can tell you the longest streak of an activity, perhaps the longest consecutive number of days you spent coding in a row or longest snapchat streak you have. As you can see binary arrays are very useful when analyzing data and tracking activities in our daily lives.

## Solutions
There are two main ways to solve binary arrays, an iterative/incremental and a recursive way. The same is the case for every type of array. Let me explain the iterative way first because it is the one with the easiest explanation. Keep in mind these solutions assume that the values in the array are either zero or one. and we are trying to find the longest streak of ones.

###iterative/incremental solutions

Iterative solutions loop through values in the array and do some operation that results with the correct answer. When it comes to the binary array there are a few possible solutions. 
#### Solution 1:
  1. Check if each value is a zero. 
  1. if it is a zero, then add the index of that zero to another array ( from now one this other array will be called arr2) after looping through all values of the array, begin arr2. 
  1. Store the Max, and current chain, and set the value of both to zero. 
  1. If the current is greater than the Max set the current chain to the Max. 
  1. When looping for clarity sake, declare two more variables, the current index and the previous index (the previous index is just the current index subtract by one. 
  1. Set the current chain to the value of the array at the current index subtract by the value of the array of the previous index.
  1. Make sure that the previous index is not outside the bounds of the array when doing this by starting them both off as zero and then subtracting them right before the next iteration.
* Proof:
Now I will try to prove this without just running the program against some tests. Using techniques in the book Introduction to Algorithms or CLRS short. The way to handle iterative/incremental solutions is to discuss loop invariants. The loop invariant is...(tbd)
